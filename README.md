# PyBer Analysis

## Project Overview

In this project, I helped PyBer create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I made a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. The report you are seeing is the final result summarizing how the data differs by city type and how decision-makers can use those differences at PyBer.

## PyBer Analysis Results

- The DataFrame Summary:
    - Overall, we can see that the Urban city type outperformed the other two types in terms of Total Rides, Total Drivers, and Total Fare.
    
    However, in terms of Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver, it has the least amount of dollars, and Rural had the highest amount of money.
    
    From this, we can assume that even though most of the rides happened in the Urban area, it only contains short trips with a small fare per trip. On the other hand, most of the Rural area trips are long trips with a large fare per trip.
